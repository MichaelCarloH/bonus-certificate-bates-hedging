    Explains the Bates formula and its significance in pricing Bonus Certificates.

    The Bates formula is a mathematical model used to price options, particularly in the context of 
    exotic options like Bonus Certificates. It combines the features of the Black-Scholes model 
    with a jump diffusion process, allowing for the incorporation of sudden price changes in the 
    underlying asset. This is particularly relevant for assets that exhibit jumps due to news 
    events or other market dynamics.

    Key components of the Bates formula include:

    1. **Volatility**: The model accounts for both continuous and jump volatility, providing a 
       more accurate representation of the underlying asset's price movements.

    2. **Jump Intensity**: This parameter captures the frequency of jumps in the asset price, 
       which can significantly impact the pricing of options.

    3. **Jump Size Distribution**: The formula allows for the modeling of the size of jumps, 
       which can be critical in assessing the risk and potential returns of the Bonus Certificate.

    The Bates formula is particularly useful for pricing Bonus Certificates linked to stocks that 
    are subject to high volatility and sudden price changes. By incorporating these factors, 
    financial institutions can better assess the value of the Bonus Certificate and manage their 
    risk exposure effectively.
